### Hi, I'm Julio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who loves diving deep into how things work, from the low-level mechanics of assembly to the complex architecture of scalable microservices. I enjoy the challenge of solving puzzles, whether it's reversing a website's API or building a practical AI tool.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm Exploring

* **Reverse Engineering & Systems:** I'm fascinated by systems penetration and game internals. There's a certain thrill to the idea that "Everything is Open Source if you can read assembly."
* **Building with Microservices:** I enjoy creating scalable systems using **Python** and **TypeScript**. I have experience building out services for everything from chatbots to data analysis pipelines.
* **The Web Scraping Game:** I love the cat-and-mouse game of scraping and reversing websites. It's a constant learning process to find new ways to gather data.
* **Practical AI:** I'm interested in using AI as a tool to solve real-world problems. My focus is on practical applications that improve efficiency, rather than just the theory.

### ðŸš€ Some Things I've Built

#### Python
- [**QuickType-Bot**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/QuickType-Bot): A bot I made to play typing games like MonkeyType using Google's OCR.
- [**DataCleaning-TID**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/DataCleaning-TID): A collection of scripts for cleaning and preparing messy datasets.
- [**TID_Grupo**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/TID_Grupo) & [**TID-GRUPO02**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/TID-GRUPO02): Used a Kaggle dataset to classify suspicious purchasing behavior.
- [**SOM-TID**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/SOM-TID): Implemented a Self-Organizing Map for data analysis.
- [**Hamiltonian transformer**](https://github.com/danielmdzrgz/HamiltonianCircuit): A reduction from the Hamiltonian circuit problem to the Vertex Cover problem.
- **Google Trends Scraper:** (Private) A project to reverse and scrape Google Trends data.

#### Unity C#
- [**Whack-an-Animal**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/Whack-an-animal): A classic Whack-A-Mole game, but built in Unity for 360-degree VR.

#### C++
- [**Auto-Compiler-Cpp**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/Auto-compiler-cpp): A simple `automake`-like tool to speed up C++ project compilation.

#### Go
- [**Windows File Size Explorer**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/windows-file-size-explorer): A handy tool for finding what's eating up your disk space on Windows.

#### TypeScript
- [**Chimp**](https://github.com/cracksuxer/chimp): A tough memory puzzle game where you repeat patterns of lighted squares.
